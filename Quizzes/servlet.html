<h2> Answers for Servlet Quiz</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p class="question">What is the difference between a web server and a web container?</p>
        <p class="answer">  "Web server refers to an execution infrastructure that handles HTTP requests and responses.
            a servlet container refers to a component that handles the lifecycle for servlets.
            an application server refers to a framework (servlet container, EJB container, JSP engine, MQ container, etc.) for handling Web applications.
            However, a Web container has a couple of meanings depending on the source. Most refer to a Web container as the part of an application server that manages servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, and other Web-tier components.
            Web container is the infrastructure for managing the lifecycle for Web services.</p>
    </li>

    <li><p class="question">What is a servlet?</p>
        <p class="answer">A servlet is a Java program that runs on a Web server. servlet is processed on the server rather than a client's machine.
            Servlets are often run when the user clicks a link, submits a form, or performs another type of action on a website.
            Java Servlets are server-side Java program modules that process and answer client requests and implement the servlet interface.
            It helps in enhancing Web server functionality with minimal overhead, maintenance and support.
            A servlet acts as an intermediary between the client and the server. As servlet modules run on the server, they can receive and respond to requests made by the client.
            Request and response objects of the servlet offer a convenient way to handle HTTP requests and send words data back to the client.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="question">How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?
    </p>
        <p class="answer">Whenever a client sends a request to the J2EE application server for a particular servlet, the J2EE Application server passes the request to the Web container.
            p class="answer">The Web container checks whether an instance of the requested servlet exists.
            If the servlet instance exists then the Web container delegates the request to the servlet, which process the client request and sends back the response.
            In case the servlet instance does not exist, the Web container locates and loads the servlet class.
            The Web container then creates an instance of the servlet and initializes it. The servlet instance starts processing the request after initialization.
            The Web container passes the response generated by the servlet to the client.
            The Web container manages a servlet by invoking various life cycle methods. These methods are defined in the Servlet API.</p>
    </li>
    It is a collection of classes and interfaces that we can use to develop a servlet. These classes and interfaces are packaged in the javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages.
    <li><p class="question">Who creates request objects?
    </p>
        <p class="answer">The request object is an instance of a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest object.
            Each time a client requests a page the JSP engine creates a new object to represent that request.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?</p>
        <p class="answer">The javax.servlet.Servlet interface defines the life cycle methods of servlet such as init(), service() and destroy().
            The Web container invokes the init(), service() and destroy() methods of a servlet during its life cycle.
            The sequence in which the Web container calls the life cycle methods of a servlet is:</p>
    </li>
    The Web container loads the servlet class and creates one or more instances of the servlet class.
    The Web container invokes init() method of the servlet instance during initialization of the servlet. The init() method is invoked only once in the servlet life cycle.
    The Web container invokes the service() method to allow a servlet to process a client request.
    The service() method processes the request and returns the response back to the Web container.
    The servlet then waits to receive and process subsequent requests
    The Web container calls the destroy() method before removing the servlet instance from the service.
    The destroy() method is also invoked only once in a servlet life cycle.
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">Who calls init and when?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            A servlet's init(ServletConfig) method is called by the server immediately after the server constructs the servlet's instance.
            Depending on the server and its configuration, this can be at any of these times:
            When the server starts
            When the servlet is first requested, just before the service() method is invoked
            At the request of the server administrator
            In any case, init() is guaranteed to be called before the servlet handles its first request.
            The init() method is typically used to perform servlet initialization--creating or loading objects that are used by the servlet in the handling of its requests.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><p class="question">Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            init()- we can Possibly override If you have initialization code (connecting to a database) then you will override the init() method
            service()-No, Very unlikely. We should NOT override the service() method.
            Your job is to override the doGet(), doPost() methods and let the service() implemenation from HTTPServlet worry about calling the right one
            doGet() and doPost()- we should Always override at least ONE of doGet() or doPost()
            You can call each other to cover both options, for example doGet() could call doPost() method which has the code
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><p class="question">In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            A Java servlet container/web server is typically multithreaded.
            That means, that multiple requests to the same servlet may be executed at the same time.
            Therefore, you need to take concurrency into consideration when you implement your servlet.
            Servlets are intrinsically multithreaded.This means a single instance can be accessed by more than one thread.
        </p>

    </li>
    <li><p class="question">What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables? </p>
        <p class="answer">
            If you absolutely can't deal with synchronizing, you can declare that your servlet &amp;quot;
            implements SingleThreadModel&amp;quot;. This empty interface tells the web server to only send one client request at a time into your servlet.
            From the JavaDoc: &amp;quot;If the target servlet is flagged with this interface, the servlet programmer is guaranteed that no two threads will execute concurrently the service method of that servlet.
            This guarantee is ensured by maintaining a pool of servlet instances for each such servlet, and dispatching each service call to a free servlet.
            In essence, if the servlet implements this interface, the servlet will be thread safe.&amp;quot;
            Note that this is not an ideal solution, since performance may suffer (depending on the size of the instance pool), plus it's more difficult to share data across instances than within a single instance.
