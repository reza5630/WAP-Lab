        <li> <span> 
                What is the difference between the following 2 statements?<br>
                setTimeout(booyah , 2000);<br>
                setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);<br>
             </span>
            <div>
                setTimeout(booyah, 2000) :  It waits for 2000 ms before loading the function.<br>
                setTimeout(booyah(), 2000) :  It calls the function immediately, rather than waiting for the specified time<br>
            </div>

        </li><br>


        <li> <span> 
            What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)<br>
            <img src="functionAlert.JPG" alt="functionAlertCode"/>
            </span>
            <div>
                it alerts 6 twice
            </div>

        </li> <br>


        <li> <span> Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that 
                says "BOOYAH!"</span>
            <div>
                    <img src="twoFunctions.jpeg" alt="twoFunctionsCode"/>
            </div>

        <li> <span> What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons 
                for using it)?  </span>
            <div>
                    HTML with minimal JavaScript inside is called Unobtrusive Javascript. It uses the DOM to attach and execute all JavaScript to the web page.<br>
                    The practical application of using Unobtrusive Javascript is:<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Usability: An unobtrusive DOM script does not draw the attention of the user -
                            visitors use it without thinking about it.</li>
                        <li>Graceful degradation: Unobtrusive DOM scripts never generate error messages, in
                            any browser, even when they fail. If features cannot be presented properly, they
                            silently disappear.</li>
                        <li>Accessibility: If any script fails, the page still delivers its core functions and
                            information via the markup, stylesheets and/or server-side scripting.</li>
                        <li>
                            Separation: For the benefit of other and future web developers, all JavaScript code
                            is maintained separately, without impacting other files of script, markup or code.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
            </div>

        </li><br>        
    </ol>
